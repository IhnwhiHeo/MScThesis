This folder contains the research archive of the simulation study performed for the research report. It contains the following files:

- `1.Execute.R` | Run this wrapper file to obtain results.

- `2.CreateTable.R` | Run this file to obtain a tabulated summary of the results.

- `3.CreateFigure.R` | Run this file to obtain the results plotted.


And the following folders:

- `Functions` | Contains modular functions used in wrapper file `1.Execute.R`.

- `Results` | Archive of the results and/or R environment created by running `1.Execute.R`.

- `Writeup` | Research report about the simulation study (e.g., R Markdown, PDF, literature, figures).

To reproduce the simulation results, run `1.Execute.R`, display these results with `2.CreateTable.R`, and visualize these results with `3.CreateFigure.R`.

Note: *The ShinyMICE project will **not** be complete before June 2020. There will be errors. You have been warned.*
