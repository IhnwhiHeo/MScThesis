# Introduction

Research goals...

develop a valid method to investigate the plausibility of multiply imputed data based on: 

- models (imputation and non-response)

- data features (cross-tabs, point estimates, aggregate statistics, etc.)

- assumptions

- algorithmic convergence


# Literature review



“There is no clear-cut method for determining when the MICE algorithm has converged” (@buur18, \textsection 6.5).

“Convergence is diagnosed when the variance between different sequences is no larger than the variance within each individual sequence” (@buur18, \textsection 6.5).

“Several expository reviews are available that assess convergence diagnostics for MCMC methods (Cowles and Carlin 1996; Brooks and Gelman 1998; El Adlouni, Favre, and Bobée 2006). Cowles and Carlin (1996) conclude that “automated convergence monitoring (as by a machine) is unsafe and should be avoided.” No method works best in all circumstances. The consensus is to assess convergence with a combination of tools. The added value of using a combination of convergence diagnostics for missing data imputation has not yet been systematically studied” (@buur18, \textsection 6.5).

"As MICE is an iterative procedure, it is important that convergence is achieved. This may be checked by computing, at each cycle, the means of imputed values and/or the values of regression coefficients, and seeing if they are stable" (@whit11, p. 394).


# Approach

R Shiny...

ShinyMICE

- single measure to assess whether algorithm converged (based on Gelman-Rubin statistic?)

- data visualizations pre and post imputation (scatterplots, densities, cross-tabs)

- statistical evaluation of relations between variables pre and post imputation (chi square or t-tests)


# Initial proposal

ShinyMice: an evaluation suite for multiple imputation
Supervisors: Prof.dr. Stef van Buuren, Dr. Gerko Vink 

The MICE package in R is a world-leading software package for multiple imputation. When using the mice function to solve missing data, vast amounts of information are calculated and stored. However, the MICE package currently lacks a user-friendly means of assessing this information. This project focuses on developing and programming novel means of evaluating, presenting and organising this information in a web-browser based local app that allows for 1) comparing the imputed data to the observations, 2) inspecting the algorithmic convergence, 3) inspecting multivariate distributions, 4) the plausibility of the imputed data, and so on. During this project you will work closely with the developers of MICE in R and the coding components in this project will focus on R and Shiny. 

The objective of the research is to 1) create a Shiny app to investigate and evaluate multiply imputed data sets, 2) implement it in MICE in R, 3) write an instructional vignette, 4) write a technical paper on the workings and usage of the software aimed at e.g. the R Journal or Journal of Statistical Software. The expected output is a state-of-the-art shiny app that can find its way into MICE.
