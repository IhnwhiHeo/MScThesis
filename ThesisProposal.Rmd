# Introduction

Research goals...

develop a valid method to investigate the plausibility of multiply imputed data based on: 

- models (imputation and non-response)

- data features (cross-tabs, point estimates, aggregate statistics, etc.)

- assumptions

- algorithmic convergence


# Literature review

Van Buuren, 2018...

# Approach

R Shiny...

ShinyMICE

- single measure to assess whether algorithm converged (based on Gelman-Rubin statistic?)

- data visualizations pre and post imputation (scatterplots, densities, cross-tabs)

- statistical evaluation of relations between variables pre and post imputation (chi square or t-tests)
